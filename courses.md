# **Courses, Training, & Formal Education**

## **1. University Courses**
The DF courses listed are all MSc level. Why no BSc you ask? Because I've yet to encounter a graduate of a DF BSc programme who was actually taught anything about DF during their course. 

If you want to go into DF and you're wondering what to study at BSc level, a normal Computer Science programme is the best choice.

If you've graduated from a great programme I'm unaware of, please let me know and I'll be happy to include it!

### **University College Dublin - Ireland**
The [Forensic Computing & Cybercrime Investigation MSc](https://www.ucd.ie/cci/education/prospective_students/fcci_programmes/module_options.html) is very popular amongst Law Enforcement. It is almost exclusively online, with attendance on campus for exams only.  Note that this programme admits those in Law Enforcement. They did also have a civilian equivalent with the [MSc in Digital Investigation & Forensic Computing](https://www.ucd.ie/cci/education/prospective_students/msc_difc.html) which has some slightly different, less sensitive content, but they don't seem to be accepting new applicants at the moment.

### **Champlain College - USA**
Their [Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics](https://www.champlain.edu/cybersecurity-and-digital-forensics) is extremely well regarded in US LEAs, and is recognised by the United States National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. They offer both online and in-person courses.

### **NTNU - Norway**
The [Information Security MSc](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mis) offers a DF pathway. The teaching language is English, and is taught at their campus in Gj√∏vik. The DF faculty is highly regarded, and produces quality research. This would be a good program if you wanted to stay in the research side of DF. A bonus is that tuition is free for EEA nationals. 

## **2. Tool Vendor Courses**
These courses mainly teach you how to use a given tool, though many do go deeper. Quality and price can vary wildly. It is almost never worth paying for these courses yourself. You would not be expected to have attended any of these for an entry-level position, but you should ask for them once you have a foot in the door and a training budget. 

### **X-Ways Forensics**
X-Ways offer high-quality training at a reasonable price. Pricing and course content can be viewed [here](https://www.x-ways.net/training/index.html).
The training courses are taught by the developers of the tools, and they are extremely knowledgeable about their subject matter. However, you will need a solid base understanding of DF to avoid becoming confused. 

### **Opentext**
Makers of Encase. They offer a variety of different courses, which can be viewed [here](https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/services/training-and-learning-services/encase-training). They tend to go through the fundamentals of what they're doing a bit more than other equivalent courses. They also offer a year-long subscription during which you can take an unlimited amount of courses, which can be good value if you like their tools.

### **Basis Technologies**
Makers of Autopsy, a GUI for The Sleuth Kit. They offer a short, 8-hour introduction to using their tool [here](https://training.autopsy.com/). Currently free for US Law Enforcement. This is very tool focused, and is aimed at teaching established forensicators how to use Autopsy effectively.

## **3. Other Courses**

### SANS
Very well regarded, very high quality training, very expensive. They have an extensive catalogue of courses covering a wide variety of DF topics [here](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/?focus-area=digital-forensics). This is another one to ask for once you're employed and have a training budget, don't pay for these out of your own pocket. 

### IACIS
They provide several courses along the pathway to their Certified Computer Forensic Examiner (CFCE) certification, starting with the Basic Computer Forensic Examiner training [here](https://www.iacis.com/training/). The course is well regarded, and assumes no prior knowledge.
