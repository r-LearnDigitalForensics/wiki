## Do I need a degree/certification to get a job?
No, not always. 

As in all things, experience and knowledge trumps credentials. Most interviews for entry-level positions will incorporate some kind of exam or knowledge check to make sure you know what you're talking about. Having a degree can make it easier to get that initial interview though.

You also have the option of becoming a law enforcement officer and working your way into the Digital Forensics Unit. However, many LEAs are civilianising their DF departments, so if you're only interested in DF and no other aspects of law enforcement be careful. 

One place where degrees and certs have value is when presenting evidence in court, as they can be a useful shorthand for some level of "competence". 

## What can I expect during a DF job interview?
It'll be different for every organisation. I've seen some great interviews, and I've seen some terrible ones.

Generally, an interview for a DF job will be in two parts. A competency-based interview, and a written exam. 

If you're interviewing for a Law Enforcement job, make sure you understand the crime risks in the community you'll be working in. You will be expected to know the priorities of the organisation, and how DF fits into this. You should understand the pressures on the organisation and DF departments in general, and be able to explain your understanding of them. Make sure you know the [ACPO Guidelines](http://library.college.police.uk/docs/acpo/digital-evidence-2012.pdf) and why they're important.

The written test should be fairly basic, but wide ranging. A good test will be looking at your attention to detail and logical skills, as well as your computer knowledge. 

If you've followed our [Getting Started Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnDigitalForensics/), you should be well prepared for most interviews.

## Will I have to see Child Abuse Sexual Material (CSAM)?
Yes, almost certainly. If you're in law enforcement, approximately 70% of your DF work will be CSAM related. 

Even if you're working in a Digital Forensic area that has less CSAM contact, you will undoubtedly be dealing with some forms of serious crime, which can be traumatic. 

Any professional organisation should have mandatory psychological screening before hiring, and then every six months as a minimum. They should also provide access to a councillor whenever you feel it's necessary. Ask about this in your interview - if they don't, then question if that is a role you should be taking.

If you're unsure if you want to deal with this every day, but still want to work in a DF-like field, consider eDiscovery or Incident Response.

## Do I have to be a programmer?
No, but your life will be much easier if you know a bit. Sometimes you'll come across data that your existing tools just won't parse. What are you going to do then? You write your own!

The two languages recommended for DF are Python and Bash. 

One of the best Python courses available is [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). Lots of forensicators still use Python 2.7. Don't be that guy, learn Python 3.

If you follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnDigitalForensics/) and have completed the [Linux LEO](https://linuxleo.com/) course, you'll already be familiar with basic Bash scripting. 

To learn more about Linux and Bash, consider working your way through the [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) series. These are great for hands-on learning, and you'll be able to convince all your friends that you're a hacker. 

## Do I need any expensive equipment to learn?
Nope! Basically any computer released in the last 10 years can be used for DF learning. 

When you're employed, you'll (hopefully) be provided with a beefy battlestation to tear through jobs with, but you're not in any rush at the moment! 

## What Operating System should I use for DF?
Basically anything you want. An OS is a tool - it's how you use it that matters. 

Most commercial tools run on Windows, while Linux has a vast assortment of open-source tools. It can be helpful to have a Mac to do MacOS jobs, due to the idiosyncrasies of the APFS file system.

The best system to learn on is arguably Linux, following the [Linux LEO](https://linuxleo.com/) course, as you'll get a much greater understanding of what you're doing than with some of the "push-button" tools in Windows. 

## Will I have to give evidence in Court?
Almost certainly. Your job is to use Computer Science to determine facts in cases, you should always expect to be called to give evidence in Court. 

This can be intimidating at first, but depending on your personality you might even enjoy it!

If possible, you should visit your local Court and sit in the public gallery for a day. This will give you a good experience of the procedure, and allow you to prepare yourself for being in the box. 

Professional organisations should provide Courtroom training for you - ask if this is offered in your interview. 

## Will I have to interview suspects?
Maybe. You will be an expert in your field, and it may be required that you lead or assist in suspect interviews to ensure the right questions are being asked. 

Interviewing suspects is a skill not every forensicator will develop, but it is highly useful if you can. Being involved in; and having an appreciation of; all stages of an investigation will make you a more complete investigator.

## Will I have to attend crime scenes and searches?
Maybe. Similar to interviewing suspects, your expertise can be very useful on the scene of a crime. You can help determine what needs to be bagged and tagged, and what can be ignored, based on your professional judgement. 

Performing a thorough, methodical search is also a skill, and is not as easy as you'd think. People with something to hide usually hide it will. 

## I'm studying DF and need a project/capstone idea. Can you give me one?
Nope. Ask your supervisor if they have any aspects of their research projects you can assist with. We have no idea what your level of knowledge and ability is. If you can't think of a good project yourself, then perhaps consider another aspect of Computer Science for your capstone.

Once you have a project, if you need help and advice then feel free to create a post!
