## Do I need a degree/certification to get a job?
No, not always. 

As in all things, experience and knowledge trumps credentials. Most interviews for entry-level positions will incorporate some kind of exam or knowledge check to make sure you know what you're talking about. Having a degree can make it easier to get that initial interview though.

You also have the option of becoming a law enforcement officer and working your way into the Digital Forensics Unit. However, many LEAs are civilianising their DF departments, so if you're only interested in DF and no other aspects of law enforcement be careful. 

One place where degrees and certs have value is when presenting evidence in court, as they can be a useful shorthand for some level of "competence". 

## Will I have to see Child Abuse Sexual Material (CSAM)?
Yes, almost certainly. If you're in law enforcement, approximately 70% of your DF work will be CSAM related. 

Even if you're working in a Digital Forensic area that has less CSAM contact, you will undoubtedly be dealing with some forms of serious crime, which can be traumatic. 

Any professional organisation should have mandatory psychological screening before hiring, and then every six months as a minimum. They should also provide access to a councillor whenever you feel it's necessary. Ask about this in your interview - if they don't, then question if that is a role you should be taking.

If you're unsure if you want to deal with this every day, but still want to work in a DF-like field, consider eDiscovery or Incident Response.

## Do I have to be a programmer?
No, but your life will be much easier if you know a bit. Sometimes you'll come across data that your existing tools just won't parse. What are you going to do then? You write your own!

The two languages recommended for DF are Python and Bash. 

One of the best Python courses available is [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). Lots of forensicators still use Python 2.7. Don't be that guy, learn Python 3.

If you follow our [Getting Started Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnDigitalForensics/) and have completed the [Linux LEO](https://linuxleo.com/) course, you'll already be familiar with basic Bash scripting. 

To learn more about Linux and Bash, consider working your way through the [OverTheWire Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) series. These are great for hands-on learning, and you'll be able to convince all your friends that you're a hacker. 

## Do I need any expensive equipment to learn?
Nope! Basically any computer released in the last 10 years can be used for DF learning. 

When you're employed, you'll (hopefully) be provided with a beefy battlestation to tear through jobs with, but you're not in any rush at the moment! 

## What Operating System should I use for DF?
Basically anything you want. An OS is a tool - it's how you use it that matters. 

Most commercial tools run on Windows, while Linux has a vast assortment of open-source tools. It can be helpful to have a Mac to do MacOS jobs, due to the idiosyncrasies of the APFS file system.

The best system to learn on is arguably Linux, following the [Linux LEO](https://linuxleo.com/) course, as you'll get a much greater understanding of what you're doing than with some of the "push-button" tools in Windows.
