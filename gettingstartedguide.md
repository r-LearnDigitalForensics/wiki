# Getting Started Guide
The following steps are designed to get you familiar with the core competencies of DF as quickly as possible. You should follow them in order to get the most out of your learning. 

## Step 1. Understanding Best Practice in Digital Forensics
The **ACPO Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence** [(Association of Chief Police Officers, 2012)](http://library.college.police.uk/docs/acpo/digital-evidence-2012.pdf) gives guidelines on identifying, preserving, and recovering electronic evidence. Four main principles are outlined in the guide:

>1. No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court.
>2. In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions.
>3. An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and achieve the same result.
>4. The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.

This should be considered the Hippocratic Oath of the forensicator. All aspects of your work should be done with these four principles in mind. It is naturally geared towards Law Enforcement, but the principles are equally valid for any investigation that may end up in court. 

## Step 2. Do the Reading - A Comprehensive Overview of Digital Forensics
The best textbook to introduce yourself to DF concepts is [Ã…rnes, A. (Ed.). (2018). Digital Forensics. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons Inc.](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Forensics-Andr%C3%A9-%C3%85rnes-ebook/dp/B072MPTVHM). It provides a comprehensive overview of basic Digital Forensics theory.
You should read this book from front to back. If you don't find it absolutely riveting, you should question if DF is the right pathway for you.  

## Step 3. Get Some Practical Experience 
The best practical introduction to Digital Forensics is the [Linux LEO](https://linuxleo.com/) guide. 
It provides a comprehensive guide to using Linux as a forensic platform, while teaching you the fundamentals of DF theory. 
As a nice side effect, you'll learn how to use Linux too!

## Step 4. Broaden your scope
[13 Cubed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8ntxFEudOCRZYT1f7ya9Q) is a great resource for introductions to a wide variety of Digital Forensics topics. His video content is an excellent way to dive into some more specific DF topics and tools.
