# Reference Library
Below are some key texts in the field of Digital Forensics. The goal is not to provide an exhaustive list of every book on the subject, but to provide guidance to a small amount of quality works.

## General Textbook
### [**Årnes, A. (Ed.). (2018). Digital Forensics.**](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Forensics-Andr%C3%A9-%C3%85rnes-ebook/dp/B072MPTVHM)
A great beginner textbook. Provides a wide overview of Digital Forensic theory and practice, and performing a robust investigation from start-to-finish.

## Windows Forensics
### [**Carvey, Harlan. (2018). Investigating Windows Systems.**](https://www.amazon.com/Investigating-Windows-Systems-Harlan-Carvey-ebook/dp/B07GKW4TRH/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&qid=1594888061&refinements=p_27%3AHarlan+Carvey&s=books&sr=1-3&text=Harlan+Carvey)
A great guide, that walks you through the process of Windows investigations. Of particular note is Chapter 3 covering User Activity, and Chapter 5 detailing how to set up an environment for your own testing.

### [**Carvey, Harlan. (2016). Windows Registry Forensics: Advanced Digital Forensic Analysis of the Windows Registry.**](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Registry-Forensics-Advanced-Forensic/dp/012803291X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=registry+forensics&qid=1594888340&s=books&sr=1-1)
While containing some out-of-date information, this book provides an excellent overview of the Windows Registry and it's forensic importance. Once you have the base level of knowledge and understanding, you can find newer registry artifacts online.

## MacOS Forensics
### [**mac4n6 by Sarah Edwards**](https://www.mac4n6.com/)
Not a book, but a great blog for cutting edge MacOS and iOS forensics.

### [**Bradley, Jaron. (2016). OS X Incident Response: Scripting and Analysis.**](https://www.amazon.com/OS-Incident-Response-Scripting-Analysis-ebook/dp/B01FHOHHVS)
A solid, if out of date, guide to MacOS Forensics. Of particular note is Chapter 4 - File System covering HFS+ artefacts.

### **Apple File System (APFS)***
At the moment, there's no comprehensive reference for APFS written from a DF perspective (that I'm aware of!). Until it arrives, you'll have to rely on Apple's documentation, a great academic paper, and frequently searching for blog posts.

#### [Apple File System Reference Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/Apple-File-System-Reference.pdf)

#### [**Hansen, Kurt H. & Toolan, Fergus (2017). Decoding the APFS file system.** ***Digital Investigation***](https://cyberforensicator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DIIN_698_Revisedproof.1-min-ilovepdf-compressed.pdf)

## Linux Forensics
### [**Linux LEO by Barry Grundy**](https://linuxleo.com/)
Not strictly a Linux Forensics book, but rather a book on how to use Linux in your investigations. However, it does give a great overview on how Linux works, and is a great starting point for those less familiar with the inner workings of penguins. 

### [**Polstra, Philip. (2015). Linux Forensics.**](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Forensics-Dr-Philip-Polstra/dp/1515037630/)
Provides a good overview of Linux Forensics, and how to leverage Python and Bash to aid your investigation. This is a companion book to [Polstra's course on PentesterAcademy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=20=).

## File System Forensics
### [**Carrier, Brian. (2005). File System Forensic Analysis.**](https://www.amazon.com/System-Forensic-Analysis-Brian-Carrier/dp/0321268172/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=file+system+forensics&qid=1594894541&s=books&sr=1-1)
Quite outdated, but still a great reference from the developer of The Sleuth Kit. You'll pick up lots of transferable skills that will allow you to understand more modern file systems by using their documentation.

## Memory Forensics
### [**Ligh, Michael Hale. et al. (2014). The Art of Memory Forensics: Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac Memory.**](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Forensics-Detecting-Malware/dp/1118825098/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=memory+forensics&qid=1594889316&s=books&sr=1-1)
The Satanic Bible of the Dark Art of Memory Forensics, written by the developers of Volatility. Heavy going, but extremely useful.

## Smartphone/Mobile Forensics
### [**Mahalek, Heather. et al. (2018). Practical Mobile Forensics,: A hands-on guide to mastering mobile forensics for the iOS, Android, and the Windows Phone platforms, 3rd Edition**](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Mobile-Forensics-hands-mastering-ebook/dp/B077PW8SVN/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=smartphone+forensics&qid=1594889499&s=books&sr=1-1)
Published by Packt, whose books can be hit or miss. This is one of the better ones. It will give you a good base-level understanding of mobile devices to build on.

## Internet/Network Forensics
### [**Bjelland, Petter Christian. Chapter 7. Internet Forensics. Årnes, A. (Ed.). (2018). Digital Forensics.**](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Forensics-Andr%C3%A9-%C3%85rnes-ebook/dp/B072MPTVHM)
This chapter will give you a solid high-level overview of a complex topic. If this interests you, to be an effective Network Investigator, you should consider some Network Engineer-level training and textbooks.
