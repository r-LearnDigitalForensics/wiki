Lovingly plagiarised from /r/forensics.

# Format
Flairs are in the format:

    [Degree Type] | [Arena of Experience]

So, for someone with an MSc in a DF subject who's experience is in law enforcement, you'll get:

    MSc Digital Forensics | LEA

Someone with a BSc in Computer Science and works in the private sector would get:

    BSc | Private

# Verification
Send us a modmail. We need a few things from you, though:

    Proof of degree (diploma) and/or job (business card, ID, badge)
    Date + username (on a post it note or something in the photo)
    Tell us your job title + a brief description (so we get the discipline/sub-discipline right)

If your diploma doesn't state your major/concentration or speciality, send us something that does. Do you have a transcript or can you access your transcript via your student portal (alumni are granted access to that as well). Show us your major/concentration and conferral. Place the sticky note on the monitor if you are doing this online.

We don't need your real name. Some jobs require tight security when it comes to giving out info. Show us what you can and we'll try to work with you.

Just to be clear: do NOT send us images with your real name and/or employer visible. That goes for diploma, transcripts (even on a computer), ID cards, business cards, etc. Use a photo editing app or something to cover up identifying info. Black it out. Pretend you're the FBI and you're redacting a government report.

It's best to send us an imgur/photobucket/whatever link to your proof photo. Delete it when we grant and respond to your request. We don't need to keep your info, and you don't need to worry about us jeopardizing your jobs.

# Things to Note
It goes without saying that your credentials must be DF related.

Mods may decide to give out custom flair in special circumstances.

Like /r/science and /r/forensics, we expect a higher level of conduct from verified and flaired accounts. You're representing your profession on here as you would anywhere else. Please be professional and exercise caution when speculating.
